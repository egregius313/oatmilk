# `oatmilk` -- A remix of the Quaker Oat Compiler written in Rust

A toy compiler for the Oat language from University of Pennsylvania's course
*CIS 341: Compilers*. The original Oat compiler is written in OCaml. This is a
rewrite in Rust.

The compiler uses a subset of LLVM IR, referred to as "LLVMLite".
